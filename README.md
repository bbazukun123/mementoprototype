# Memento Web Prototype

The scope of this repo includes the product landing pages for the [Memento Website](https://thephotobookmemento.getprintbox.com/). The implementation was based on a design which was the result of a collaboration between **CyberPrint Group** and **Salmon House** (For reference, please see the [InVision prototype](https://invis.io/HFSLPFFE3GV). As Printbox infrastructure was built on top of Prestashop, there are limitations on how far we can take the customisation and the tools. As the result, I was only able to build the custom product landing pages while the remaining elements (including the header and the footer sections) had to be delegated to Printbox developers.
